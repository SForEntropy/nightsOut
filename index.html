    <h1 id="Heading1">Welcome to Nights Out</h1>
    <p id="openingParagraph">This website documents alternative club nights in and around London. Most of these club
        nights predominantly play songs from the 1980s to the 2000s. Because websites were not really a thing in the
        80s, and the websites from the 90s
        only had minimal styling, I've decided to style this website like a 2000s MySpace profile. This fits nicely
        because lot of the songs played at these club nights used to be our MySpace profile songs.
